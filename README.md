###NPM
- MAJOR/MINOR/PATCH NPM version history:
- MAJOR should only increment when API has incompatible features added (non backwards compatiblt)
- MINOR is for new features but the API still works like before
- PATCH is for bugfixes that doesn't add new features
- Use ~ in front of version to render PATCH number irrelevent (1.5.x)
- Use ^ in front for MINOR irrelevency (1.x.x)
- Remember to remove unnecessary commas
